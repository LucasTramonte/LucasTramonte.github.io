# Data Scientist
Technical Skills: Python, SQL, AWS, PowerBI, C/C++

### Education
- M.S., Engineering Degree | Ecole CentraleSupélec, Université Paris-Saclay  (April 2025)
- B.S., Industrial Engineering | State University of Campinas - Unicamp (December 2024)

### Work Experience
**Data Scientist Intern @ FlexSim (February 2023 - April 2023)**

- Conducted an analysis of possible no-code Machine Learning frameworks, which resulted in RapidMiner being identified as the best viable option due to its ease of use and available features. Instructed the ML engineers of the company on how to use this tool, and the tool adoption resulted in a 30% reduction in the number of tickets the department receives quarter-over-quarter
- Automated data import in the software, enabling the team to use the software without crashes when handling large datasets, by integrating SQL queries with simulation models using C++.

**Data Science Intern @ Eldorado Institute (February 2022 - September 2022)**

- Implemented data pre-processing routines and tested machine learning models to detect faults in mobile phone batteries.
- Improved fault detection precision to 73% by reducing false positives, optimizing analysts’ time and resources by 27% through the use of Python and interpretable machine learning techniques, such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

**Undergraduate research fellow @ Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq (September 2022 - August 2023)**

- Conducted research on interpreting machine learning predictions for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 from symptoms, using SHAP ((SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) methods - [github](https://github.com/LucasTramonte/SARS-CoV-2-Prediction-based-on-symptoms)
- The project was supported by BIOS (Brazilian Institute of Data Science), and carried out at the Data Analysis and Decision Support Laboratory (LAD2), FCA/Unicamp.

### Projects

**SARS-CoV-2 Maternal Impact**

Implemented data processing and statistical analysis of scientific research on the impact of different SARS-CoV-2 variants on maternal outcomes (ICU admission and mortality) in Brazil, using Python and Power BI - [github](https://github.com/LucasTramonte/Analysis-SARS-CoV-2-variants)

**MDVRP-Magazine-Luiza**

Optimization project for the Brazilian retail company Magazine Luiza by addressing the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP), developed with Python and the PuLP library - [github](https://github.com/LucasTramonte/MDVRP-Magazine-Luiza/tree/main)

**Optimization-AirFrance**

Developed an optimization project for AirFrance to enhance passenger distribution and satisfaction, using Python and the Gurobi optimization solver - [github](https://github.com/LucasTramonte/Optimization-AirFrance)

**Prediction of the SWOT analysis**

Development of a collective multicriteria decision-making method to select elements of the SWOT matrix, serving as a basis for the strategies of the university's administrative body - [github](https://github.com/LucasTramonte/swot-matrix-group-decision)
